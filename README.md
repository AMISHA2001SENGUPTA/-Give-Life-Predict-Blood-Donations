# -Give-Life-Predict-Blood-Donations
In the Give Life: Predict Blood Donations project, you will predict whether or not a donor will give blood in a given time window. The dataset used in the project is from a mobile blood donation vehicle in Taiwan, and as part of a blood donation drive, the blood transfusion service center drives to various universities to collect the blood. 

In this project, you are processing raw data and feeding it to TPOT Python AutoML(Automated Machine Learning) tool. It will search hundreds of machine learning pipelines to find the best one for our dataset. 

We will then use the information from TPOT to create our model with normalized features and get an even better score. 
Give Life: Predict Blood Donations is a guided project. You can replicate the result on a different dataset, such as the Unicorn Companies. You can use TPOT to predict whether a company reaches a valuation of over 5 billion.
